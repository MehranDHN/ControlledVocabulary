## Briefing Document: Controlled Vocabularies for Cultural Works

**Source:** Harpring, Patricia. _Introduction to Controlled Vocabularies: Terminology for Art, Architecture, and Other Cultural Works_. First edition. Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2010.

### 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of controlled vocabularies, specifically within the context of art, architecture, and other cultural works. It emphasizes their critical role in standardizing terminology for cataloging, indexing, and retrieving information about cultural objects. The core purpose of controlled vocabularies is to organize information by providing consistent terminology and by linking related concepts. This is crucial in the cultural heritage sector, where information is often nuanced, uncertain, and derived from diverse sources. The briefing details various types of controlled vocabularies, their relationships, and practical considerations for their construction, display, indexing, and retrieval. A significant focus is placed on the Getty Vocabularies as prominent examples of such tools.

### 2. Core Concepts of Controlled Vocabularies

Controlled vocabularies are fundamental tools for information organization and retrieval, particularly in specialized domains like cultural heritage.

-   **Definition and Purpose:** A controlled vocabulary is an "organized arrangement of words and phrases used to index content and/or to retrieve content through browsing or searching." Its primary purpose is "to organize information and to provide terminology to catalog and retrieve information." They "promote consistency in preferred terms and the assignment of the same terms to similar content," while "capturing the richness of variant terms" (p. 12).
-   **Addressing Information Complexity:** Cultural information is inherently complex, characterized by "conflicting opinions, changing interpretations, and information that must be expressed with nuance and indications of ambiguity and uncertainty" (p. 2). Controlled vocabularies are essential to navigate this complexity and ensure efficient information discovery.
-   **Key Functions:** The "most important functions of a controlled vocabulary are to gather together variant terms and synonyms for concepts and to link concepts in a logical order or sort them into categories" (p. 12). This helps to define relationships, such as between "a rose window and a Catherine wheel," or how "pot-metal glass is related to the more general term stained glass" (p. 12).

### 3. Types of Controlled Vocabularies

The source identifies several types of controlled vocabularies, often structured to show relationships between concepts.

-   **Subject Heading Lists:** These are "uniform words or phrases intended to be assigned to books, articles, or other documents in order to describe the subject or topic." A key characteristic is "precoordination of terminology," combining "several unique concepts together in a string," e.g., "Medieval bronze vessels" (p. 18-19). Examples include Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).
-   **Controlled Lists:** Simple lists of unique, non-overlapping terms from the same class, equal in granularity, and arranged logically. They are best for fields where a "short list of values is appropriate and where terms are unlikely to have synonyms or ancillary information" (p. 19-20). Often referred to as "pick lists" (p. 20).
-   **Synonym Ring Lists:** Sets of terms considered equivalent _for retrieval purposes_, often including "near-synonyms that have similar or related meanings" (p. 20-21). They are primarily "used behind the scenes of an electronic information system" to "broaden retrieval" (p. 21).
-   **Authority Files:** A "set of established names or headings and cross-references to the preferred form from variant or alternate forms" (p. 21). They enforce usage consistency, and "almost any type of controlled vocabulary—with the exception of a synonym ring list—may be used as an authority" (p. 21).
-   **Taxonomies:** "An orderly classification for a defined domain," comprising "controlled vocabulary terms (generally only preferred terms) organized into a hierarchical structure" (p. 22). They typically have "shallower hierarchies and a less complicated structure" than thesauri, often lacking equivalent or related terms (p. 22). Scientific classifications are classic examples.
-   **Alphanumeric Classification Schemes:** Controlled codes (letters/numbers) representing concepts, often with an implied taxonomy. The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system and Iconclass (for art iconography) are examples (p. 23-24).
-   **Thesauri:** These combine characteristics of synonym rings and taxonomies, forming a "semantic network of unique concepts, including relationships between synonyms, broader and narrower (parent/child) contexts, and other related concepts" (p. 24). They may also include definitions (scope notes) and bibliographic citations. The Getty Vocabularies are identified as prominent examples.
-   **Ontologies:** Formal, machine-readable specifications of conceptual models where "concepts, properties, relationships, functions, constraints, and axioms are all explicitly defined" (p. 24). They use strict semantic relationships for "knowledge representation in machine-readable form" (p. 25).
-   **Folksonomies:** An "assemblage of concepts represented by terms and names (called tags) that are compiled through social tagging" (p. 26). They are "not considered authoritative" and generally lack hierarchical structure or preferred terms, but can provide "additional access points not included in more formal vocabularies" (p. 26).

### 4. Relationships in Controlled Vocabularies

Structured vocabularies define relationships between terms to organize knowledge and enhance retrieval. These relationships should be reciprocal.

-   **Equivalence Relationships:** Link "synonymous terms or names for the same concept" (p. 27). This includes:
-   **Synonyms:** Terms with "identical or nearly identical" meanings, which can include different linguistic origins, dialectical variants, different languages, or scientific and common terms (p. 27).
-   **Lexical Variants:** Different word forms for the same expression, such as spelling differences, grammatical variations (e.g., singular/plural), and abbreviations (p. 29).
-   **Historical Name Changes:** Linking past and present terms for the same concept, person, or place, acknowledging that "determining when names are equivalents and when they instead refer to different entities is not always clear" (p. 30).
-   **Differences in Language:** Crucial for multilingual vocabularies, where literal translations are often insufficient and concepts must be carefully mapped (p. 30-31).
-   **Near Synonyms:** Terms with similar but not identical meanings, sometimes linked as equivalents in synonym rings to broaden retrieval (p. 32).
-   **Preferred Terms:** When multiple terms refer to the same concept, one is designated as the "preferred term" (descriptor), while others are "variant terms" (p. 33). Selection criteria should be documented and consistently applied, prioritizing the needs of the majority of users (p. 33).
-   **Homographs:** Terms "spelled identically to another term but has a different meaning" (p. 33). They require disambiguation, often through the use of "qualifiers" (e.g., "drums (column components)") (p. 35). Qualifiers should be "brief as possible," ideally "one or two words" from a broader context (p. 36).
-   **Hierarchical Relationships:** Broader/narrower (parent/child) relationships, the "primary feature that distinguishes a thesaurus or taxonomy" (p. 37).
-   **Whole/Part Relationships:** "A partitive relationship (e.g., Karnak is a part of Qinā governorate)" (p. 37).
-   **Genus/Species Relationships:** "The most common relationship... All children in a genus/species relationship should be a kind of, type of, or manifestation of the parent" (p. 38).
-   **Instance Relationships:** Where "proper names are organized by general categories of things or events," e.g., "Alps" under "mountains" (p. 39-40).
-   **Facets and Guide Terms:** Provide "primary subdivisions of a hierarchy" (facets) and "additional levels that collocate similar sets or classes of records" (guide terms), helping to organize complex hierarchies (p. 40).
-   **Polyhierarchies:** Allow a concept to "logically belong to more than one broader context," meaning a record "may be linked to multiple parents and can thus appear in multiple hierarchical views" (p. 41).
-   **Associative Relationships:** Link "records that are conceptually close, but where the relationship is neither equivalent nor hierarchical" (p. 42). These are typically "related to" relationships (RT). They should be "clear and direct" to avoid "too many associative relationships between entities that are only loosely or indirectly related" (p. 45-46).

### 5. Vocabularies for Cultural Objects (The Getty Vocabularies)

The Getty Vocabularies are highlighted as a cornerstone for describing art and material culture.

-   **Types of Terms Needed:** Cultural works require terminology for "people, corporate bodies, geographic locations, objects, iconographic subjects, and genre terms" (p. 49). Generic terms are usually lowercase, while proper names are capitalized (p. 50).
-   **The Getty Vocabularies Overview:** These are "thesauri that provide terminology, relationships, and other information about the objects, artists, concepts, and places important to various disciplines that specialize in art, architecture, and material culture" (p. 51). They serve as "sources of terminology at the data entry stage," "knowledge bases," and "search assistants" (p. 51). They are "compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction" (p. 52).
-   **Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT):** Contains "approximately 131,000 terms and other information relating to objects, materials, techniques, activities, and other concepts" (p. 52). Its scope is global, from Antiquity to present, covering "generic concepts" (e.g., "sculpture," "bronze," "Art Nouveau"), excluding proper names (p. 53). It is polyhierarchical (e.g., jade is both "metamorphic rock" and "gemstone") (p. 53). Terms require "literary warrant," meaning they are "found in an authoritative published source" (p. 56).
-   **Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN):** A "structured vocabulary containing… approximately 1,115,000 names... about places" (p. 59). It is a thesaurus with hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships, focusing on "administrative entities and physical features that have proper names" (p. 59-60), excluding mythical places and typically individual buildings (p. 60). It is polyhierarchical (e.g., Siena is under both modern Italy and historical Etruria) (p. 59).
-   **Union List of Artist Names (ULAN):** A "structured vocabulary containing… approximately 293,000 names and other information about artists and other creators of cultural works" (p. 62). It includes individual people (known or anonymous), corporate bodies (firms, workshops, families), and anonymous/unknown artists (p. 62-64). It also includes "prominent patrons" and "museums and other repositories" (p. 63). It is polyhierarchical (p. 62).
-   **Cultural Objects Name Authority (CONA):** "In the early stages of development," CONA aims to provide "brief authoritative records for works of art and architecture" (p. 65), encompassing both "built works" and "movable works" (p. 67-68).
-   **Conservation Thesaurus (CT):** Under development, intended to "improve consistency in indexing and to allow more efficient vocabulary-assisted retrieval of professional literature and other records related to the discipline of conservation" (p. 68).
-   **Other Notable Vocabularies:Chenhall’s Nomenclature for Museum Cataloging:** Classifies "man-made objects" based on their "original functional context" (p. 71). It distinguishes "object names" (common usage) from "object terms" (preferred designation) (p. 71-72). It has some overlap with the AAT but differs in scope, structure (originally less hierarchical), and the handling of synonyms and qualifiers (p. 72-73).
-   **Library of Congress Authorities (LCNAF & LCSH):** Used by libraries to establish names (LCNAF) and subject/form headings (LCSH) for bibliographic records (p. 73). LCSH is characterized by "precoordinated multiple-concept headings" (p. 75).
-   **Thesaurus for Graphic Materials (TGM):** Developed by the Library of Congress for "visual images" (p. 76), it has a "consistent hierarchical structure" (p. 77). It is broader than AAT in some subject areas but less comprehensive for art objects themselves (p. 77, 80).
-   **Iconclass:** An "alphanumeric classification scheme designed for the iconography of art, focusing primarily on religious and mythological stories and themes in Western art" (p. 80). It uses codes with "textual correlates" rather than terms (p. 80).

### 6. Interoperability of Vocabularies

The need to combine and share data from various sources necessitates interoperability.

-   **Definition:** "The ability of two or more vocabularies and their systems or components of their systems to map to each other’s data, with the goals of exchanging information and enhancing discovery" (p. 83).
-   **Methods:Direct Mapping:** "Matching of terms one-to-one in each controlled vocabulary" where there is significant overlap in content and meaning (p. 85). Can be automated or human-mediated.
-   **Switching Vocabulary:** Using "a third vocabulary... that itself can link to terms in each of the two original controlled vocabularies" (p. 86).
-   **Factors for Success:** Interoperability success depends on "scope of mapping," "similarity of content," "intended audience," "format and hierarchical structure," "precoordination and postcoordination," "granularity and specificity," and "authoritativeness" (p. 86-89). Differences in how synonyms and near-synonyms are handled also impact success (p. 88).
-   **Interoperability Across Languages:** Multilingual vocabularies face challenges like "exact equivalence," "inexact and partial equivalences," "single-to-multiple term equivalence," and "nonequivalence" (p. 90-91). "Loan terms" are preferred over "coined terms" for concepts without direct translation (p. 91). Practical applications often necessitate a "dominant language" (e.g., English for AAT) (p. 92).
-   **Satellite and Extension Vocabularies:** These are "specialized vocabularies that may fit into the structure of a larger, broader, or more generic controlled vocabulary" (p. 92). Satellite vocabularies are interoperable at multiple points, while extension vocabularies link at specific nodes (node linking) (p. 92-93).

### 7. Local Authorities

Institutions often create and maintain their own local authorities to manage terminology, often derived from published vocabularies.

-   **Purpose:** Local authorities "allow the multiple vocabularies necessary for cataloging to be combined or linked" and can be "streamlined or otherwise optimized for the particular requirements of local cataloging and retrieval applications" (p. 94). They are often built through "derivation (also called modeling) based on a published vocabulary" (p. 94).
-   **Controlled Fields:** Any information "required as a variable in a retrieval query should be indexed in controlled fields" (p. 96). Linking to authority records allows updates to be made once and propagated to all relevant work records (p. 97).
-   **Structure and Unique IDs:** Local authorities should ideally "be compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesauri" and "structured as hierarchical, relational databases" (p. 97). "Unique numeric or alphanumeric identification" should be used for each record and term (p. 98).
-   **Person/Corporate Body Authority:** Contains information on artists, architects, patrons, repositories, and other individuals or groups related to cultural works. Includes "real, historical people" and "organized, identifiable groups" (p. 99-100). Anonymous and unknown creators are also accommodated (p. 100).
-   **Place/Location Authority:** Contains information about "geographic places directly related to the work of art, architecture—such as locations or subjects—or creators of works" (p. 106). Includes physical features and administrative entities, both current and historical (p. 106).
-   **Generic Concept Authority:** Contains "information about generic concepts needed to catalog or describe works or images, including the type of object, materials, activities, its style, other attributes, or the role of a creator" (p. 113). Divided into "facets" (e.g., objects, materials, activities, styles) for organization (p. 113).
-   **Subject Authority:** Includes "iconographical subjects and other named subject matter of works of art" (p. 119). It can be used for iconography, historical events, and proper names of buildings (p. 119).
-   **Source Authority:** Essential for "recording sources for cultural heritage information," allowing for citations to publications, websites, and other references (p. 130).

### 8. Constructing a Vocabulary or Authority

Building controlled vocabularies is a "time-consuming and labor-intensive process" but offers significant benefits for consistency and retrieval (p. 133).

-   **General Criteria:** Decide on local versus broader use (with a strong recommendation for standard compliance to facilitate future sharing), purpose (cataloging, retrieval, or navigation), and scope (breadth vs. depth) (p. 133-135).
-   **Data Model and Rules:** Establish "logical focus of the record," "entity-relationship model and data structure" (often relational databases are recommended for complexity), accommodate "controlled fields vs. free-text fields," define "minimum information," and create "editorial rules" (p. 135-138).
-   **Imprecise Information:** Vocabularies for cultural heritage must account for "imprecise or ambiguous" information, such as unknown identities, uncertain dates, or scholarly disagreements (p. 138-139). This can be managed through "repeatable fields," "polyhierarchical links," and "note fields" (p. 139).
-   **Establishing Terms:** Terms require "literary warrant" from authoritative sources, consistently referring to a "definable, unique concept" (p. 140). "Preferred term" and "variant terms" should be flagged (p. 140). "User warrant" (based on user queries) and "organizational warrant" (based on internal needs) can be informal means for local vocabularies (p. 141). Capitalization should follow usage (p. 141).
-   **Regulating Hierarchical Relationships:** Ensure logical relationships "all the way up the tree" and that "each subset of narrower terms... should be independent and mutually exclusive in meaning" (p. 141). Avoid mixing relationship types without clear flagging (p. 142). "Facets and guide terms" provide consistent organization (p. 142-143).

### 9. Displaying a Controlled Vocabulary

Effective display is crucial for user adoption and understanding.

-   **User Types:** Displays should cater to "vocabulary creators," "indexers," and "end users" (general public), each with different needs (p. 144-145).
-   **Technical Considerations:** Display should be independent of database design (p. 145).
-   **Characteristics of Displays:** Multiple views (hierarchical, full record, search results) and methods of presentation (indentation, notation codes, typography) should be considered (p. 146).
-   **Hierarchical Displays:** Indented displays are generally "more user-friendly than relationship notation codes" (p. 148). Polyhierarchical relationships require careful display, often with indicators for nonpreferred parents (e.g., "[N]") (p. 149-150). Siblings can be sorted alphabetically, chronologically, or logically (p. 152).
-   **Equivalence and Associative Relationships:** Should be "clearly designated to users," distinguishing descriptors from variant terms (p. 155). Standard notations (UF, RT) are common, but user-friendly labels are preferred for general audiences (p. 156).
-   **Homograph Display:** Qualifiers are used, typically in parentheses, to disambiguate (e.g., "drums (column components)") (p. 157-158).
-   **Sorting and Alphabetizing:** Can be "word-by-word" or "letter-by-letter" (p. 158). Diacritics are often normalized for sorting to ensure consistency (p. 159).
-   **Search Results Displays:** Should include "the terms that met the criteria of the search" and "a brief reference to each concept" (p. 160, 205). "Headings or labels" (concatenated information like biographical strings or hierarchical contexts) are used for brevity and clarity in results (p. 160). Parents are often displayed in "ascending order" (narrowest to broadest) for user familiarity in headings, though "descending order" is useful for sorting (p. 162).

### 10. Indexing with Controlled Vocabularies

Indexing is the "conscious activity performed by knowledgeable catalogers who consider retrieval implications when assigning indexing terms" (p. 165).

-   **Technical Integration:** Ideally, controlled vocabularies are fully integrated into cataloging systems, allowing access to variant terms and unique identifiers (p. 166).
-   **Methodologies:Indexing Display Information:** Information in free-text display fields should also be indexed in controlled fields for retrieval (p. 167).
-   **Specificity and Exhaustivity:** Catalogers should aim for the "most specific term" where appropriate (specificity) and use a "greater number of indexing terms" (exhaustivity) to enhance search value (p. 168). Guidelines should dictate the number of terms and analytical methods (p. 170).
-   **Missing Information:** Establish "default values" (e.g., "unavailable," "unknown") for required fields when data is missing, rather than leaving them blank, to indicate the status to users (p. 171).
-   **Indexing Uncertain Information:** Distinguish between "knowable" information (unknown to cataloger due to lack of expertise) and "unknowable" information (debated by scholars or incomplete data) (p. 176). For unknowable information, "multiple possibilities should be indexed with words such as probably or perhaps in a note explaining the ambiguity" (p. 174, 176).

### 11. Retrieval Using Controlled Vocabularies

Controlled vocabularies are "extremely powerful tools for retrieval" (p. 177).

-   **User Intervention vs. Behind-the-Scenes:** Users can be guided through "user intervention" (showing expert terminology choices) or the vocabulary can be applied "entirely behind the scenes" (often for general public users) (p. 178).
-   **Retrieval Methods:Browsing:** Users scan "alphabetical lists, short pull-down lists, or in other arrangements" (p. 178-179).
-   **Search Box:** Allows users to "enter terms and compose searches." The system should use the vocabulary "behind the scenes to provide users with alternate terminology choices" (p. 181).
-   **Querying in a Database:** Users can perform "simple search[es] across the entire data set" or "fielded quer[ies]" on specific fields, which are more precise (p. 182).
-   **Reports and Ad Hoc Queries:** Advanced users may need "predefined reports" or "ad hoc queries" using query languages (e.g., SQL) to access underlying data tables (p. 185).
-   **Querying Across Multiple Databases:** Requires mapping disparate databases to a common standard and making deep Web data accessible (p. 186).
-   **Seeding Meta Tags:** Vocabularies can improve Web retrieval by adding synonyms and broader contexts to "meta tags located in the source code of a Web page" (p. 186).
-   **Processing Vocabulary Data for Retrieval:** "Efficient retrieval of vocabulary terms and names requires processing and algorithms suited to the unique characteristics of the data, which is unlike natural language" (p. 187). This often involves "preprocessing" terms for optimal search performance.
-   **Search Functionality:Using Names/Terms:** Retrieval should allow access through "any and all variant terms and names for the person, place, thing, or concept" (p. 188). This includes misspellings or unofficial names to enhance access (p. 189).
-   **Truncation:** Allows users to "search for a string of characters regardless of what other characters follow (or sometimes, precede) that string" (e. 189).
-   **Keyword Searching:** Provides access to individual words within multi-word terms (p. 190).
-   **Normalizing Terms:** Involves "removing or ignoring spaces, punctuation, diacritics, and case sensitivity" to allow comparisons on basic character strings, crucial for effective searching across diverse data (p. 191). This enables case insensitivity, accommodates compound terms/names with or without spaces, and handles diacritics/punctuation variations (p. 192-194).
-   **Singulars and Plurals:** Retrieval systems should accommodate both forms (e.g., "portals" retrieves "portal"), potentially using "automatic stemming" or specialized algorithms (p. 195).
-   **Abbreviations:** Common abbreviations should be mapped to full words (p. 196).
-   **Trunk Names:** Allow retrieval regardless of whether modifiers (e.g., "Mount" in "Mount Etna") are included in the query (p. 196).
-   **Form and Syntax:** Accommodate natural or inverted order of names (p. 197), often by "pivoting on the comma" (p. 197-198).
-   **Stop Lists:** Lists of words ignored in queries (e.g., articles, prepositions) (p. 201).
-   **Boolean Operators:** AND, OR, NOT are essential for refining searches (p. 201).
-   **Context of Terms in Retrieval:** Qualifiers and hierarchical relationships can "narrow search results" or "expand searches" (p. 202-203). Associative relationships can also "expand a search" (p. 204).
-   **Other Data in Retrieval:** Unique identifiers, place types, life roles, nationality, geographic coordinates, and dates can be used as search criteria (p. 204-205).
-   **Results Lists:** Should display matches, a brief reference to the concept, and context (e.g., hierarchical information) (p. 205).
