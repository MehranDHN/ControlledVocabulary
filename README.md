## Briefing Document: Controlled Vocabularies for Cultural Works

**Source:** Harpring, Patricia. _Introduction to Controlled Vocabularies: Terminology for Art, Architecture, and Other Cultural Works_. First edition. Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2010.

### 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of controlled vocabularies, specifically within the context of art, architecture, and other cultural works. It emphasizes their critical role in standardizing terminology for cataloging, indexing, and retrieving information about cultural objects. The core purpose of controlled vocabularies is to organize information by providing consistent terminology and by linking related concepts. This is crucial in the cultural heritage sector, where information is often nuanced, uncertain, and derived from diverse sources. The briefing details various types of controlled vocabularies, their relationships, and practical considerations for their construction, display, indexing, and retrieval. A significant focus is placed on the Getty Vocabularies as prominent examples of such tools.

### 2. Core Concepts of Controlled Vocabularies

Controlled vocabularies are fundamental tools for information organization and retrieval, particularly in specialized domains like cultural heritage.

-   **Definition and Purpose:** A controlled vocabulary is an "organized arrangement of words and phrases used to index content and/or to retrieve content through browsing or searching." Its primary purpose is "to organize information and to provide terminology to catalog and retrieve information." They "promote consistency in preferred terms and the assignment of the same terms to similar content," while "capturing the richness of variant terms" (p. 12).
-   **Addressing Information Complexity:** Cultural information is inherently complex, characterized by "conflicting opinions, changing interpretations, and information that must be expressed with nuance and indications of ambiguity and uncertainty" (p. 2). Controlled vocabularies are essential to navigate this complexity and ensure efficient information discovery.
-   **Key Functions:** The "most important functions of a controlled vocabulary are to gather together variant terms and synonyms for concepts and to link concepts in a logical order or sort them into categories" (p. 12). This helps to define relationships, such as between "a rose window and a Catherine wheel," or how "pot-metal glass is related to the more general term stained glass" (p. 12).

### 3. Types of Controlled Vocabularies

The source identifies several types of controlled vocabularies, often structured to show relationships between concepts.

-   **Subject Heading Lists:** These are "uniform words or phrases intended to be assigned to books, articles, or other documents in order to describe the subject or topic." A key characteristic is "precoordination of terminology," combining "several unique concepts together in a string," e.g., "Medieval bronze vessels" (p. 18-19). Examples include Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).
-   **Controlled Lists:** Simple lists of unique, non-overlapping terms from the same class, equal in granularity, and arranged logically. They are best for fields where a "short list of values is appropriate and where terms are unlikely to have synonyms or ancillary information" (p. 19-20). Often referred to as "pick lists" (p. 20).
-   **Synonym Ring Lists:** Sets of terms considered equivalent _for retrieval purposes_, often including "near-synonyms that have similar or related meanings" (p. 20-21). They are primarily "used behind the scenes of an electronic information system" to "broaden retrieval" (p. 21).
-   **Authority Files:** A "set of established names or headings and cross-references to the preferred form from variant or alternate forms" (p. 21). They enforce usage consistency, and "almost any type of controlled vocabulary—with the exception of a synonym ring list—may be used as an authority" (p. 21).
-   **Taxonomies:** "An orderly classification for a defined domain," comprising "controlled vocabulary terms (generally only preferred terms) organized into a hierarchical structure" (p. 22). They typically have "shallower hierarchies and a less complicated structure" than thesauri, often lacking equivalent or related terms (p. 22). Scientific classifications are classic examples.
-   **Alphanumeric Classification Schemes:** Controlled codes (letters/numbers) representing concepts, often with an implied taxonomy. The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system and Iconclass (for art iconography) are examples (p. 23-24).
-   **Thesauri:** These combine characteristics of synonym rings and taxonomies, forming a "semantic network of unique concepts, including relationships between synonyms, broader and narrower (parent/child) contexts, and other related concepts" (p. 24). They may also include definitions (scope notes) and bibliographic citations. The Getty Vocabularies are identified as prominent examples.
-   **Ontologies:** Formal, machine-readable specifications of conceptual models where "concepts, properties, relationships, functions, constraints, and axioms are all explicitly defined" (p. 24). They use strict semantic relationships for "knowledge representation in machine-readable form" (p. 25).
-   **Folksonomies:** An "assemblage of concepts represented by terms and names (called tags) that are compiled through social tagging" (p. 26). They are "not considered authoritative" and generally lack hierarchical structure or preferred terms, but can provide "additional access points not included in more formal vocabularies" (p. 26).

### 4. Relationships in Controlled Vocabularies

Structured vocabularies define relationships between terms to organize knowledge and enhance retrieval. These relationships should be reciprocal.

-   **Equivalence Relationships:** Link "synonymous terms or names for the same concept" (p. 27). This includes:
-   **Synonyms:** Terms with "identical or nearly identical" meanings, which can include different linguistic origins, dialectical variants, different languages, or scientific and common terms (p. 27).
-   **Lexical Variants:** Different word forms for the same expression, such as spelling differences, grammatical variations (e.g., singular/plural), and abbreviations (p. 29).
-   **Historical Name Changes:** Linking past and present terms for the same concept, person, or place, acknowledging that "determining when names are equivalents and when they instead refer to different entities is not always clear" (p. 30).
-   **Differences in Language:** Crucial for multilingual vocabularies, where literal translations are often insufficient and concepts must be carefully mapped (p. 30-31).
-   **Near Synonyms:** Terms with similar but not identical meanings, sometimes linked as equivalents in synonym rings to broaden retrieval (p. 32).
-   **Preferred Terms:** When multiple terms refer to the same concept, one is designated as the "preferred term" (descriptor), while others are "variant terms" (p. 33). Selection criteria should be documented and consistently applied, prioritizing the needs of the majority of users (p. 33).
-   **Homographs:** Terms "spelled identically to another term but has a different meaning" (p. 33). They require disambiguation, often through the use of "qualifiers" (e.g., "drums (column components)") (p. 35). Qualifiers should be "brief as possible," ideally "one or two words" from a broader context (p. 36).
-   **Hierarchical Relationships:** Broader/narrower (parent/child) relationships, the "primary feature that distinguishes a thesaurus or taxonomy" (p. 37).
-   **Whole/Part Relationships:** "A partitive relationship (e.g., Karnak is a part of Qinā governorate)" (p. 37).
-   **Genus/Species Relationships:** "The most common relationship... All children in a genus/species relationship should be a kind of, type of, or manifestation of the parent" (p. 38).
-   **Instance Relationships:** Where "proper names are organized by general categories of things or events," e.g., "Alps" under "mountains" (p. 39-40).
-   **Facets and Guide Terms:** Provide "primary subdivisions of a hierarchy" (facets) and "additional levels that collocate similar sets or classes of records" (guide terms), helping to organize complex hierarchies (p. 40).
-   **Polyhierarchies:** Allow a concept to "logically belong to more than one broader context," meaning a record "may be linked to multiple parents and can thus appear in multiple hierarchical views" (p. 41).
-   **Associative Relationships:** Link "records that are conceptually close, but where the relationship is neither equivalent nor hierarchical" (p. 42). These are typically "related to" relationships (RT). They should be "clear and direct" to avoid "too many associative relationships between entities that are only loosely or indirectly related" (p. 45-46).

### 5. Vocabularies for Cultural Objects (The Getty Vocabularies)

The Getty Vocabularies are highlighted as a cornerstone for describing art and material culture.

-   **Types of Terms Needed:** Cultural works require terminology for "people, corporate bodies, geographic locations, objects, iconographic subjects, and genre terms" (p. 49). Generic terms are usually lowercase, while proper names are capitalized (p. 50).
-   **The Getty Vocabularies Overview:** These are "thesauri that provide terminology, relationships, and other information about the objects, artists, concepts, and places important to various disciplines that specialize in art, architecture, and material culture" (p. 51). They serve as "sources of terminology at the data entry stage," "knowledge bases," and "search assistants" (p. 51). They are "compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction" (p. 52).
-   **Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT):** Contains "approximately 131,000 terms and other information relating to objects, materials, techniques, activities, and other concepts" (p. 52). Its scope is global, from Antiquity to present, covering "generic concepts" (e.g., "sculpture," "bronze," "Art Nouveau"), excluding proper names (p. 53). It is polyhierarchical (e.g., jade is both "metamorphic rock" and "gemstone") (p. 53). Terms require "literary warrant," meaning they are "found in an authoritative published source" (p. 56).
-   **Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN):** A "structured vocabulary containing… approximately 1,115,000 names... about places" (p. 59). It is a thesaurus with hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships, focusing on "administrative entities and physical features that have proper names" (p. 59-60), excluding mythical places and typically individual buildings (p. 60). It is polyhierarchical (e.g., Siena is under both modern Italy and historical Etruria) (p. 59).
-   **Union List of Artist Names (ULAN):** A "structured vocabulary containing… approximately 293,000 names and other information about artists and other creators of cultural works" (p. 62). It includes individual people (known or anonymous), corporate bodies (firms, workshops, families), and anonymous/unknown artists (p. 62-64). It also includes "prominent patrons" and "museums and other repositories" (p. 63). It is polyhierarchical (p. 62).
-   **Cultural Objects Name Authority (CONA):** "In the early stages of development," CONA aims to provide "brief authoritative records for works of art and architecture" (p. 65), encompassing both "built works" and "movable works" (p. 67-68).
-   **Conservation Thesaurus (CT):** Under development, intended to "improve consistency in indexing and to allow more efficient vocabulary-assisted retrieval of professional literature and other records related to the discipline of conservation" (p. 68).
-   **Other Notable Vocabularies:Chenhall’s Nomenclature for Museum Cataloging:** Classifies "man-made objects" based on their "original functional context" (p. 71). It distinguishes "object names" (common usage) from "object terms" (preferred designation) (p. 71-72). It has some overlap with the AAT but differs in scope, structure (originally less hierarchical), and the handling of synonyms and qualifiers (p. 72-73).
-   **Library of Congress Authorities (LCNAF & LCSH):** Used by libraries to establish names (LCNAF) and subject/form headings (LCSH) for bibliographic records (p. 73). LCSH is characterized by "precoordinated multiple-concept headings" (p. 75).
-   **Thesaurus for Graphic Materials (TGM):** Developed by the Library of Congress for "visual images" (p. 76), it has a "consistent hierarchical structure" (p. 77). It is broader than AAT in some subject areas but less comprehensive for art objects themselves (p. 77, 80).
-   **Iconclass:** An "alphanumeric classification scheme designed for the iconography of art, focusing primarily on religious and mythological stories and themes in Western art" (p. 80). It uses codes with "textual correlates" rather than terms (p. 80).

### 6. Interoperability of Vocabularies

The need to combine and share data from various sources necessitates interoperability.

-   **Definition:** "The ability of two or more vocabularies and their systems or components of their systems to map to each other’s data, with the goals of exchanging information and enhancing discovery" (p. 83).
-   **Methods:Direct Mapping:** "Matching of terms one-to-one in each controlled vocabulary" where there is significant overlap in content and meaning (p. 85). Can be automated or human-mediated.
-   **Switching Vocabulary:** Using "a third vocabulary... that itself can link to terms in each of the two original controlled vocabularies" (p. 86).
-   **Factors for Success:** Interoperability success depends on "scope of mapping," "similarity of content," "intended audience," "format and hierarchical structure," "precoordination and postcoordination," "granularity and specificity," and "authoritativeness" (p. 86-89). Differences in how synonyms and near-synonyms are handled also impact success (p. 88).
-   **Interoperability Across Languages:** Multilingual vocabularies face challenges like "exact equivalence," "inexact and partial equivalences," "single-to-multiple term equivalence," and "nonequivalence" (p. 90-91). "Loan terms" are preferred over "coined terms" for concepts without direct translation (p. 91). Practical applications often necessitate a "dominant language" (e.g., English for AAT) (p. 92).
-   **Satellite and Extension Vocabularies:** These are "specialized vocabularies that may fit into the structure of a larger, broader, or more generic controlled vocabulary" (p. 92). Satellite vocabularies are interoperable at multiple points, while extension vocabularies link at specific nodes (node linking) (p. 92-93).

### 7. Local Authorities

Institutions often create and maintain their own local authorities to manage terminology, often derived from published vocabularies.

-   **Purpose:** Local authorities "allow the multiple vocabularies necessary for cataloging to be combined or linked" and can be "streamlined or otherwise optimized for the particular requirements of local cataloging and retrieval applications" (p. 94). They are often built through "derivation (also called modeling) based on a published vocabulary" (p. 94).
-   **Controlled Fields:** Any information "required as a variable in a retrieval query should be indexed in controlled fields" (p. 96). Linking to authority records allows updates to be made once and propagated to all relevant work records (p. 97).
-   **Structure and Unique IDs:** Local authorities should ideally "be compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesauri" and "structured as hierarchical, relational databases" (p. 97). "Unique numeric or alphanumeric identification" should be used for each record and term (p. 98).
-   **Person/Corporate Body Authority:** Contains information on artists, architects, patrons, repositories, and other individuals or groups related to cultural works. Includes "real, historical people" and "organized, identifiable groups" (p. 99-100). Anonymous and unknown creators are also accommodated (p. 100).
-   **Place/Location Authority:** Contains information about "geographic places directly related to the work of art, architecture—such as locations or subjects—or creators of works" (p. 106). Includes physical features and administrative entities, both current and historical (p. 106).
-   **Generic Concept Authority:** Contains "information about generic concepts needed to catalog or describe works or images, including the type of object, materials, activities, its style, other attributes, or the role of a creator" (p. 113). Divided into "facets" (e.g., objects, materials, activities, styles) for organization (p. 113).
-   **Subject Authority:** Includes "iconographical subjects and other named subject matter of works of art" (p. 119). It can be used for iconography, historical events, and proper names of buildings (p. 119).
-   **Source Authority:** Essential for "recording sources for cultural heritage information," allowing for citations to publications, websites, and other references (p. 130).

### 8. Constructing a Vocabulary or Authority

Building controlled vocabularies is a "time-consuming and labor-intensive process" but offers significant benefits for consistency and retrieval (p. 133).

-   **General Criteria:** Decide on local versus broader use (with a strong recommendation for standard compliance to facilitate future sharing), purpose (cataloging, retrieval, or navigation), and scope (breadth vs. depth) (p. 133-135).
-   **Data Model and Rules:** Establish "logical focus of the record," "entity-relationship model and data structure" (often relational databases are recommended for complexity), accommodate "controlled fields vs. free-text fields," define "minimum information," and create "editorial rules" (p. 135-138).
-   **Imprecise Information:** Vocabularies for cultural heritage must account for "imprecise or ambiguous" information, such as unknown identities, uncertain dates, or scholarly disagreements (p. 138-139). This can be managed through "repeatable fields," "polyhierarchical links," and "note fields" (p. 139).
-   **Establishing Terms:** Terms require "literary warrant" from authoritative sources, consistently referring to a "definable, unique concept" (p. 140). "Preferred term" and "variant terms" should be flagged (p. 140). "User warrant" (based on user queries) and "organizational warrant" (based on internal needs) can be informal means for local vocabularies (p. 141). Capitalization should follow usage (p. 141).
-   **Regulating Hierarchical Relationships:** Ensure logical relationships "all the way up the tree" and that "each subset of narrower terms... should be independent and mutually exclusive in meaning" (p. 141). Avoid mixing relationship types without clear flagging (p. 142). "Facets and guide terms" provide consistent organization (p. 142-143).

### 9. Displaying a Controlled Vocabulary

Effective display is crucial for user adoption and understanding.

-   **User Types:** Displays should cater to "vocabulary creators," "indexers," and "end users" (general public), each with different needs (p. 144-145).
-   **Technical Considerations:** Display should be independent of database design (p. 145).
-   **Characteristics of Displays:** Multiple views (hierarchical, full record, search results) and methods of presentation (indentation, notation codes, typography) should be considered (p. 146).
-   **Hierarchical Displays:** Indented displays are generally "more user-friendly than relationship notation codes" (p. 148). Polyhierarchical relationships require careful display, often with indicators for nonpreferred parents (e.g., "[N]") (p. 149-150). Siblings can be sorted alphabetically, chronologically, or logically (p. 152).
-   **Equivalence and Associative Relationships:** Should be "clearly designated to users," distinguishing descriptors from variant terms (p. 155). Standard notations (UF, RT) are common, but user-friendly labels are preferred for general audiences (p. 156).
-   **Homograph Display:** Qualifiers are used, typically in parentheses, to disambiguate (e.g., "drums (column components)") (p. 157-158).
-   **Sorting and Alphabetizing:** Can be "word-by-word" or "letter-by-letter" (p. 158). Diacritics are often normalized for sorting to ensure consistency (p. 159).
-   **Search Results Displays:** Should include "the terms that met the criteria of the search" and "a brief reference to each concept" (p. 160, 205). "Headings or labels" (concatenated information like biographical strings or hierarchical contexts) are used for brevity and clarity in results (p. 160). Parents are often displayed in "ascending order" (narrowest to broadest) for user familiarity in headings, though "descending order" is useful for sorting (p. 162).

### 10. Indexing with Controlled Vocabularies

Indexing is the "conscious activity performed by knowledgeable catalogers who consider retrieval implications when assigning indexing terms" (p. 165).

-   **Technical Integration:** Ideally, controlled vocabularies are fully integrated into cataloging systems, allowing access to variant terms and unique identifiers (p. 166).
-   **Methodologies:Indexing Display Information:** Information in free-text display fields should also be indexed in controlled fields for retrieval (p. 167).
-   **Specificity and Exhaustivity:** Catalogers should aim for the "most specific term" where appropriate (specificity) and use a "greater number of indexing terms" (exhaustivity) to enhance search value (p. 168). Guidelines should dictate the number of terms and analytical methods (p. 170).
-   **Missing Information:** Establish "default values" (e.g., "unavailable," "unknown") for required fields when data is missing, rather than leaving them blank, to indicate the status to users (p. 171).
-   **Indexing Uncertain Information:** Distinguish between "knowable" information (unknown to cataloger due to lack of expertise) and "unknowable" information (debated by scholars or incomplete data) (p. 176). For unknowable information, "multiple possibilities should be indexed with words such as probably or perhaps in a note explaining the ambiguity" (p. 174, 176).

### 11. Retrieval Using Controlled Vocabularies

Controlled vocabularies are "extremely powerful tools for retrieval" (p. 177).

-   **User Intervention vs. Behind-the-Scenes:** Users can be guided through "user intervention" (showing expert terminology choices) or the vocabulary can be applied "entirely behind the scenes" (often for general public users) (p. 178).
-   **Retrieval Methods:Browsing:** Users scan "alphabetical lists, short pull-down lists, or in other arrangements" (p. 178-179).
-   **Search Box:** Allows users to "enter terms and compose searches." The system should use the vocabulary "behind the scenes to provide users with alternate terminology choices" (p. 181).
-   **Querying in a Database:** Users can perform "simple search[es] across the entire data set" or "fielded quer[ies]" on specific fields, which are more precise (p. 182).
-   **Reports and Ad Hoc Queries:** Advanced users may need "predefined reports" or "ad hoc queries" using query languages (e.g., SQL) to access underlying data tables (p. 185).
-   **Querying Across Multiple Databases:** Requires mapping disparate databases to a common standard and making deep Web data accessible (p. 186).
-   **Seeding Meta Tags:** Vocabularies can improve Web retrieval by adding synonyms and broader contexts to "meta tags located in the source code of a Web page" (p. 186).
-   **Processing Vocabulary Data for Retrieval:** "Efficient retrieval of vocabulary terms and names requires processing and algorithms suited to the unique characteristics of the data, which is unlike natural language" (p. 187). This often involves "preprocessing" terms for optimal search performance.
-   **Search Functionality:Using Names/Terms:** Retrieval should allow access through "any and all variant terms and names for the person, place, thing, or concept" (p. 188). This includes misspellings or unofficial names to enhance access (p. 189).
-   **Truncation:** Allows users to "search for a string of characters regardless of what other characters follow (or sometimes, precede) that string" (e. 189).
-   **Keyword Searching:** Provides access to individual words within multi-word terms (p. 190).
-   **Normalizing Terms:** Involves "removing or ignoring spaces, punctuation, diacritics, and case sensitivity" to allow comparisons on basic character strings, crucial for effective searching across diverse data (p. 191). This enables case insensitivity, accommodates compound terms/names with or without spaces, and handles diacritics/punctuation variations (p. 192-194).
-   **Singulars and Plurals:** Retrieval systems should accommodate both forms (e.g., "portals" retrieves "portal"), potentially using "automatic stemming" or specialized algorithms (p. 195).
-   **Abbreviations:** Common abbreviations should be mapped to full words (p. 196).
-   **Trunk Names:** Allow retrieval regardless of whether modifiers (e.g., "Mount" in "Mount Etna") are included in the query (p. 196).
-   **Form and Syntax:** Accommodate natural or inverted order of names (p. 197), often by "pivoting on the comma" (p. 197-198).
-   **Stop Lists:** Lists of words ignored in queries (e.g., articles, prepositions) (p. 201).
-   **Boolean Operators:** AND, OR, NOT are essential for refining searches (p. 201).
-   **Context of Terms in Retrieval:** Qualifiers and hierarchical relationships can "narrow search results" or "expand searches" (p. 202-203). Associative relationships can also "expand a search" (p. 204).
-   **Other Data in Retrieval:** Unique identifiers, place types, life roles, nationality, geographic coordinates, and dates can be used as search criteria (p. 204-205).
-   **Results Lists:** Should display matches, a brief reference to the concept, and context (e.g., hierarchical information) (p. 205).

# FAQ


### What is a controlled vocabulary and why is it essential for cultural heritage information?

A controlled vocabulary is an organized system of standardized words and phrases used to categorize, index, and retrieve information. For cultural works—products of human creativity with visual aesthetic expression—controlled vocabularies are critical. They help address the inherent complexity of art information, which is often characterized by conflicting opinions, changing interpretations, ambiguity, and uncertainty (e.g., a work attributed to different artists over time).

The primary purpose of controlled vocabularies is to organize information and provide consistent terminology for cataloging and retrieval. Without them, catalogers might use different terms for the same person, place, or object, hindering efficient search. They also serve end-users, who may not be specialists and might use various synonyms or more generic terms. Controlled vocabularies gather variant terms, synonyms, and link concepts logically (e.g., "rose window" and "Catherine wheel" being the same thing, or "pot-metal glass" relating to "stained glass"), ensuring these connections are defined and maintained for both cataloging and retrieval.

### How do "display information" and "controlled information" differ in cultural object records?

Cultural object records typically contain both descriptive and administrative data, which serve two distinct purposes: display to end-users and efficient retrieval.

**Display Information:** This information is intended for direct viewing by end-users and is designed to express nuance, ambiguity, and uncertainty accurately. For example, a "Creator Description" field might use natural language, including terms like "probably" or "circa," to reflect scholarly uncertainty (e.g., "probably 1711"). While display fields can be free-text, they may also be concatenated from controlled data. The goal is to be easily readable and understandable by humans.

**Controlled Information:** This data is specially formatted and often linked to controlled vocabularies (authorities) or controlled lists, or governed by formatting restrictions (e.g., numbers in date fields). It's primarily used for indexing and retrieval, where consistency and precise rules are paramount. For instance, while a "Display Creation Date" might be free-text, corresponding "Earliest Date" and "Latest Date" fields would be numerical, allowing for consistent search queries across time spans. The system might use controlled vocabulary terms in fields like "Role" or "Material Name." The separation ensures that the richness and complexity of art information can be conveyed to users, while still enabling efficient and consistent data retrieval behind the scenes.

### What are the main types of controlled vocabularies used for cultural heritage, and how do they differ?

The main types of controlled vocabularies used for cultural heritage, each with distinct characteristics, include:

1.  **Subject Heading Lists:** These are uniform words or phrases assigned to describe the subject or topic of documents, often combining several unique concepts into a single string (e.g., "Medieval bronze vessels"). They emphasize a preferred entry with cross-references to synonyms. The Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) is a prominent example.
2.  **Controlled Lists (Flat Term Lists/Pick Lists):** Simple lists of unique, non-overlapping terms from the same class, arranged logically. They are used for specific database fields where a short, finite list of values is appropriate and terms are unlikely to have synonyms or ancillary information (e.g., "Classification" field with "paintings," "sculpture," etc.).
3.  **Synonym Ring Lists:** Sets of terms considered equivalent solely for retrieval purposes. Unlike other vocabularies, they often include "near synonyms" or broadly related terms to expand search results, and are typically used behind the scenes rather than for indexing.
4.  **Authority Files:** Sets of established names or headings with cross-references from variant or alternate forms to the preferred form. Common types include name authority files (e.g., Library of Congress/NACO Authority File - LCNAF) and subject heading authority files. Almost any controlled vocabulary (except synonym rings) can function as an authority if accepted as authoritative for consistent data use.
5.  **Taxonomies (Faceted Vocabularies):** Hierarchically structured controlled vocabularies, generally containing only preferred terms. They emphasize parent/child (broader/narrower) relationships (e.g., whole/part, genus/species, instance relationships) and typically have shallower hierarchies and simpler structures than thesauri, often lacking equivalent or related terms.
6.  **Alphanumeric Classification Schemes:** Controlled codes (letters and/or numbers) representing concepts or headings, with an implied taxonomy. The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Iconclass (for art iconography) are examples.
7.  **Thesauri:** Semantic networks of unique concepts, combining characteristics of synonym rings and taxonomies. They include equivalence (synonym), hierarchical (whole/part, genus/species, instance), and associative relationships, often with additional explanatory information (scope notes, citations). Thesauri are complex and powerful, widely recommended for art and cultural heritage databases. The Getty vocabularies (AAT, TGN, ULAN) are prominent examples.
8.  **Ontologies:** Formal, machine-readable specifications of conceptual models that explicitly define concepts, properties, relationships, and constraints. They use controlled vocabularies and a grammar to link them, aiming for knowledge representation in machine-readable form, with stricter semantic relationships than thesauri.
9.  **Folksonomies:** Assemblages of terms ("tags") created through decentralized social tagging by individuals or groups in an online environment. They typically lack hierarchical structure, preferred terms, and are not considered authoritative or systematically applied by professional indexers, often characterized by nonstandard terminology.

### What are the "Getty Vocabularies" and what is their scope?

The Getty Vocabularies are a suite of thesauri developed and maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, designed to provide terminology, relationships, and other information crucial for various disciplines specializing in art, architecture, and material culture. They serve as cataloging tools, knowledge bases for researchers, and search assistants for online resources.

As of the provided text, the main Getty Vocabularies include:

1.  **Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT):** Contains approximately 131,000 terms related to objects, materials, techniques, activities, and other generic concepts in art, architecture, decorative arts, material culture, and archival materials. Its scope is global and covers antiquity to the present, excluding proper names and iconographic subjects. It is polyhierarchical and includes equivalence and associative relationships.
2.  **Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN):** Contains around 1,115,000 names and information about places (administrative entities and physical features with proper names). It covers prehistory to the present, globally, and is polyhierarchical, including equivalence and associative relationships. It generally excludes smaller urban features (buildings, streets) and mythical places.
3.  **Union List of Artist Names (ULAN):** Contains approximately 293,000 names and information about artists and other creators of cultural works. It includes individual people (known and anonymous, with established oeuvres), corporate bodies (firms, workshops, families), patrons, and repositories. Its scope is global, from antiquity to the present, focusing on creators of visual arts of museum-collection caliber. It is generally structured as a flat thesaurus with hierarchical (for corporate bodies) and associative relationships.
4.  **Cultural Objects Name Authority (CONA):** Currently under development, CONA aims to provide brief authoritative records for unique works of art and architecture, including built works and movable works (paintings, sculpture, photographs, performance art, archaeological artifacts, functional objects). Its scope is global, from prehistory to the present, covering works cataloged in scholarly literature, museum collections, and other art-focused projects.

All Getty Vocabularies are designed to be compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction, derived from published sources, and continuously updated through contributions from cultural heritage communities worldwide.

### What are the three primary types of relationships in controlled vocabularies?

Controlled vocabularies, especially thesauri, use three primary types of relationships to organize terms and concepts:

1.  **Equivalence Relationships:** These link synonymous terms or names that refer to the _same concept_. They account for:

-   **True Synonyms:** Terms with identical or nearly identical meanings (e.g., "elevators" and "lifts").
-   **Lexical Variants:** Different word forms for the same expression, due to spelling, grammatical variation, or abbreviations (e.g., "watercolor" and "watercolour," or singular/plural forms).
-   **Historical Name Changes:** Old names for entities that have changed over time (e.g., "Hottentot" and "KhoiKhoi").
-   **Differences in Language:** Terms referring to the same concept in different languages (e.g., "ceramics," "cerámica," "Keramik"). One term is typically designated as the "preferred term" or "descriptor," with others as "variant terms" or "used for terms."

1.  **Hierarchical Relationships:** These represent broader/narrower (parent/child) relationships between concepts, organizing them into a tree-like structure. There are several types:

-   **Whole/Part Relationships (Partitive):** Where a child is a physical or conceptual part of the parent (e.g., "Karnak" is part of "Qinā governorate," or a "façade" is part of a "cathedral").
-   **Genus/Species Relationships (Generic):** Where a child is a kind of, type of, or manifestation of the parent (e.g., "bronze" is a type of "metal," or "sculpture" is a type of "artwork"). This is the most common type.
-   **Instance Relationships:** Where proper names (instances) are organized under general categories (e.g., "Alps" under "mountains"). Thesauri often allow for "polyhierarchical relationships," meaning a concept can have more than one parent (e.g., "Siena" being part of both "modern Italy" and "historical Etruria").

1.  **Associative Relationships:** These link concepts that are conceptually close but whose relationship is neither equivalent nor hierarchical. The most basic type is "related to." More specific types might be defined depending on the vocabulary's domain (e.g., "Final Neolithic" and "Early Bronze Age" in the AAT, or "teacher of" / "student of" relationships between artists in the ULAN). These relationships help users discover related concepts that might not fit neatly into a hierarchy or be strict synonyms. They should only be recorded for clear and direct connections to avoid overwhelming the thesaurus.

### What are the challenges and methods for achieving interoperability between controlled vocabularies?

Achieving interoperability between controlled vocabularies, which is the ability for two or more vocabularies to map to each other's data for information exchange and enhanced discovery, is complex but crucial for shared data environments.

**Challenges:**

-   **Differing Scope and Content:** Vocabularies are often developed for specific communities and domains, leading to varying levels of depth, breadth, and content overlap. Mapping an art vocabulary to a medical one, for instance, would be largely ineffective due to dissimilar content.
-   **Intended Audience:** If vocabularies are designed for vastly different audiences (e.g., K-12 students vs. subject experts), their terminology, specificity, and structure may be incompatible.
-   **Format and Hierarchical Structure:** Differences in how terms are formatted (e.g., capitalization, punctuation) and how hierarchies are structured (e.g., single vs. multiple parents, depth of branches) can hinder accurate mapping.
-   **Precoordination vs. Postcoordination:** Some vocabularies use "precoordinated" terms (multiple concepts combined in one string, like "Baroque cathedrals"), while others use "postcoordinated" terms (individual concepts combined at retrieval). This difference complicates one-to-one mapping.
-   **Granularity and Specificity:** Variations in the precision or level of detail of terms across vocabularies make exact matches difficult.
-   **Synonymy Handling:** Some vocabularies link only "true synonyms," while others include "near synonyms," affecting the accuracy of equivalence mapping.
-   **Authoritativeness:** Different criteria for establishing terms' authority (literary warrant, user warrant, organizational warrant) can lead to inconsistencies in meaning.
-   **Multilingual Issues:** Literal translation often fails to capture nuances, cultural context, or differing concepts across languages (e.g., "toasting glasses" vs. "vasos para tostar"). Single-to-multiple term equivalences or nonequivalences are common.
-   **Maintenance:** Mappings become obsolete as vocabularies evolve, requiring ongoing maintenance.

**Methods for Achieving Interoperability:**

1.  **Direct Mapping:** Involves matching terms one-to-one between two vocabularies where significant overlap exists. This can be done through computer algorithms, human mediation, or a combination. Subject experts are crucial for judging inexact equivalents.
2.  **Switching Vocabulary:** A third, intermediary vocabulary (a "switching vocabulary") links terms from two or more original vocabularies. This can unify hierarchical displays or provide a broader conceptual scheme to reconcile differences.
3.  **Semantic Mapping:** Uses a defined underlying organizational structure or conceptual scheme to map terms based on their meanings and relationships. This can involve complex relationships beyond simple hierarchies, categorizing the degree of closeness between linked terms (e.g., exact synonyms, near synonyms). Ontologies are a sophisticated form of semantic mapping.
4.  **Satellite and Extension Vocabularies:** These are specialized "microcontrolled vocabularies" designed to integrate with larger, existing vocabularies. Satellite vocabularies link at multiple points, while extension vocabularies often link at a few "nodes," effectively adding a new branch to the original. This allows for specialized detail without overwhelming the broader vocabulary, while maintaining interoperability.
5.  **Multilingual Development:** Ideally, multilingual vocabularies are developed as a single unified system where terms in different languages are exact equivalents from the outset, rather than trying to map independently developed ones. This accounts for translation idiosyncrasies and cultural contexts during development.

Ultimately, successful interoperability requires careful planning, adherence to standards (like ISO/NISO), and often significant human intervention by subject matter experts, especially when dealing with complex or nuanced cultural heritage information.

### What are "Local Authorities" and how are they created and maintained?

**Local authorities** are controlled vocabularies developed and maintained by individual institutions for their specific cataloging and retrieval needs. They are crucial because no single published vocabulary can meet all the diverse terminology requirements of every collection.

**Creation:**

-   **Derivation (Modeling):** A common method is to derive the local authority from a published, authoritative vocabulary (e.g., using portions of the AAT). This ensures consistency in term selection, hierarchical structure, and format, promoting future interoperability.
-   **Populating with Published Terms:** Local authorities should primarily be populated with terminology from established controlled vocabularies like the Getty Vocabularies or Library of Congress Authorities, rather than inventing terms from scratch. This leverages existing expertise and standards.
-   **Adding Local Terminology:** They can incorporate terms not found in published authorities, including institution-specific terms, non-expert terms (e.g., common object names for public displays), or even "wrong" terms (e.g., common misspellings) to enhance access for specific user groups. These local additions may be flagged as such.
-   **Unique Identifiers:** Each record and term within the local authority should be assigned a unique numeric or alphanumeric identifier. This is crucial for linking records (e.g., work records to authority records) and for allowing updates to flow from external published vocabularies.
-   **Defined Structure:** Ideally, local authorities should be structured as hierarchical, relational databases, compliant with standards like ISO and NISO for thesauri, and guided by data models from standards like CDWA and CCO. This allows for complex relationships (equivalence, hierarchical, associative) and flexible data management.
-   **Minimum Information:** Institutions define core required fields for each record, ensuring essential information is always present, with optional fields filled incrementally.
-   **Editorial Rules:** Consistent editorial rules must be established and meticulously followed for warrant, term choice, hierarchical placement, and formatting. These rules should be documented and updated by an authorized team.

**Maintenance:**

-   **Living, Growing Tools:** Terminology in cultural heritage is dynamic. Local authorities must be treated as "living, growing tools" that are continuously updated.
-   **Contribution to Standards:** Institutions are encouraged to contribute their new local terms (if within scope) back to existing standard vocabularies like the Getty Vocabularies or Library of Congress Authorities. This fosters collaboration, avoids redundant efforts, and enhances broader interoperability.
-   **Updates from Published Sources:** The use of unique IDs and proper data structures facilitates receiving and incorporating updates from published controlled vocabularies as they evolve.
-   **Imprecise Information:** Local authorities must be designed to accommodate inherent imprecision and ambiguity in art information (e.g., uncertain artist dates, debated interpretations). This is done through repeatable fields for multiple possibilities, polyhierarchical links, and descriptive notes that explain uncertainty without making false assumptions.

The primary advantages of local authorities are customization for specific collections, increased consistency in cataloging, and enhanced retrieval by accommodating a wide range of user queries.

### How do human indexers use controlled vocabularies to describe cultural works, and what factors influence their indexing decisions?

Human indexers (catalogers) use controlled vocabularies as crucial tools to systematically evaluate information about cultural works and assign standardized terms, thereby enabling efficient searching and access. This process, known as "indexing," is a conscious activity performed by knowledgeable professionals.

**Methodologies for Indexing:**

1.  **Controlled Fields for Retrieval:** All important information from free-text display fields should also be indexed in corresponding controlled fields to ensure good access. Indexing fields may not always be visible to end-users, allowing for broader or more liberal indexing (e.g., using estimated date ranges for internal search).

-   **Specificity and Exhaustivity:Specificity:** Indexers aim for the most precise or granular term available in the vocabulary (e.g., "amphora" rather than "storage vessel").
-   **Exhaustivity:** Refers to the depth and breadth of description, often achieved by assigning a greater number of indexing terms. Guidelines are established to ensure systematic and consistent indexing across the collection (e.g., indexing materials by importance, or subjects by generic, specific, and symbolic meaning).

1.  **Core Elements and Minimal Records:** Cataloging institutions define "core fields" and "minimal records" to ensure a baseline of required information for every entry, even if it means repeating terms (e.g., if "Subject" and "Work Type" are both required and share the same term).
2.  **Handling Missing Information:** If core information is unavailable, default values (e.g., "unknown," "unavailable," "destroyed") are used, or fields are left blank but data can be supplied at the public access end from other related fields (e.g., culture from the "Culture" field for an "unknown" artist).
3.  **Different Works, Different Indexing:** The nature of the work itself can dictate the level of specificity. A sculpture cast from a single material might need only one material term, while a complex mixed-media piece requires multiple.
4.  **Indexing Groups vs. Items:** For archival groups, indexers decide whether to assign terms applicable to all items in the group or only to the most important ones.
5.  **Preferred or Variant Terms:** Ideally, the system allows indexers to use any term (preferred, variant, historical, or foreign language equivalent) from the same vocabulary concept record that best fits the context, as long as all these terms are linked to the same underlying concept.
6.  **Uncertain Information:** Indexers are trained to distinguish between "knowable but unknown" (due to lack of research/expertise) and "unknowable/debated" information.

-   For knowable but unknown data, indexers should use broader, accurate terms or omit the information, avoiding guesses.
-   For unknowable or debated information (where authoritative sources disagree), multiple possibilities can be indexed (e.g., both "Zeus" and "Poseidon" if scholarly opinion is split), with the ambiguity explained in a descriptive note.

**Factors Influencing Decisions:**

-   **System Capabilities:** Technical limitations of the cataloging system (e.g., inability to link to hierarchical authorities) may force adjustments in indexing practice (e.g., explicitly indexing both specific terms and their broader contexts).
-   **Availability of Vocabulary:** Integration of controlled vocabularies directly into the cataloging system is ideal, providing access to variant terms and unique identifiers, which supports consistent updates.
-   **Size and Focus of Collection:** Large, homogeneous collections may require more specific indexing, while smaller, diverse collections might use broader terms. Resource constraints can also limit exhaustivity.
-   **Expertise of End-Users:** Indexing decisions are influenced by who the ultimate users will be. If the system serves a wide range from scholars to the general public, indexing might include both expert and non-expert terms or be designed for intermediary retrieval vocabularies.
-   **Expertise of Catalogers:** The subject expertise of individual catalogers affects the precision and depth of indexing.

In essence, indexing with controlled vocabularies is a balance between rigorous adherence to standards, practical constraints, and a deep understanding of both the cultural material and the information needs of diverse users.

### How do controlled vocabularies enhance information retrieval in online environments?

Controlled vocabularies significantly enhance information retrieval in online environments by addressing the variability and complexity of human language, leading users to the information they seek, regardless of the specific terms they use.

**Key ways vocabularies enhance retrieval:**

1.  **Bridging Terminology Gaps:** Users often don't know the exact "expert" term (e.g., "rhyton" vs. "drinking horn"). Vocabularies contain synonyms and variant terms, allowing users to search with familiar language while retrieving records indexed with specialized terminology.

-   **Broadening and Narrowing Searches:Hierarchical Relationships:** Users searching for a broad term (e.g., "storage vessels") can be offered the option to include all its "narrower terms" (e.g., "amphorae," "pithoi") in their query, expanding relevant results. Conversely, specific terms can be used to narrow searches from broader concepts.
-   **Associative Relationships:** These can suggest related concepts that might be of interest (e.g., if a user searches for "frescoes," they might be offered "sinopie").
-   **User Intervention vs. Behind the Scenes:** Systems can either guide users by suggesting alternative terms (user intervention) or automatically expand queries with synonyms and related terms without explicit user input (behind the scenes), making the experience simpler for general users.

1.  **Improving Precision:** By using controlled terms for indexing, search results are more accurate and precise compared to free-text keyword searching. Fielded queries (searching specific fields like "artist" or "medium") further refine results. Qualifiers (e.g., "drums (column components)") and hierarchical context can be used to disambiguate homographs and narrow overly broad searches.
2.  **Handling Language Variations:** Multilingual vocabularies link terms across different languages, allowing users to retrieve information regardless of the language used in the query or the original indexing.
3.  **Robust Keyword Searching:** Vocabularies enable sophisticated keyword searching. They provide access to all words within multi-word terms (e.g., searching "buttresses" retrieves "flying buttresses"). They also allow for exact phrase searching (using quotes) to prevent false hits from common keywords.
4.  **Normalization for Flexibility:** Terms are "normalized" (stripping case, spaces, punctuation, diacritics) for internal processing, allowing users to search without precise spelling, capitalization, or diacritic usage (e.g., "Jean Simeon Chardin" retrieves "Jean-Siméon Chardin"). This also helps with singular/plural forms and abbreviations.
5.  **Handling Name Variations:** Vocabularies accommodate nicknames, pseudonyms, common misspellings, and various syntactical forms of names (e.g., inverted order), ensuring users can find entities regardless of how they are listed (e.g., "Le Corbusier" or "Charles Édouard Jeanneret-Gris"). Special algorithms can "pivot" on commas to create useful variants of multi-part names.
6.  **Metadata Tagging:** Vocabularies can "seed" meta tags in web page source code with synonyms and broader contexts, improving visibility to general search engines.
7.  **Querying Across Multiple Databases:** By providing standardized terminology and mappings, vocabularies facilitate "federated searching" across disparate databases, platforms, and institutions, even those in the "deep Web."
8.  **Refined Reporting and Analysis:** For advanced users, controlled vocabularies allow for precise ad hoc queries and predefined reports, enabling detailed analysis of the underlying data.

In essence, controlled vocabularies act as intelligent intermediaries between the user's query and the indexed content, significantly expanding the scope of relevant results while maintaining or improving precision.

### What are the key considerations and rules for constructing a new controlled vocabulary or authority?

Constructing a new controlled vocabulary or authority is a labor-intensive process that requires careful planning and adherence to established rules to ensure consistency, usability, and future interoperability.

**Key Considerations (General Criteria):**

1.  **Purpose and Audience:** Define the primary purpose (cataloging, retrieval, navigation) and the intended audience (experts, general public). This influences term selection, relationships, and display. A compromise is often needed if one vocabulary serves both indexing (expert focus) and retrieval (broader terms, near-synonyms).
2.  **Scope:** Precisely define the realm of knowledge covered (e.g., time period, geographic extent, topical subjects) and what is excluded. Decide on breadth vs. depth. Complex vocabularies benefit from "facets" and other logical divisions.
3.  **Maintainability:** Plan for ongoing maintenance, as terminology changes over time. Investigate contributing new terms to existing standard vocabularies (e.g., Getty, Library of Congress) to avoid redundant efforts and enhance interoperability.
4.  **Compliance with Standards:** Aim for compliance with national and international standards for vocabulary construction (e.g., ISO, NISO, CDWA, CCO). This facilitates future data sharing and integration with larger contexts.
5.  **Logical Focus of Record:** Determine the core entity each record represents (e.g., a person, a place, a generic concept). For medium to large vocabularies, creating separate vocabularies for distinct data types (e.g., people vs. geographic places) is more efficient.
6.  **Data Model and Structure:** Establish an entity-relationship model and data structure, ideally a relational database, to handle complex relationships and editorial requirements. Plan for controlled fields (linked to vocabularies/lists) and free-text fields (for nuance/ambiguity).
7.  **Minimum Information:** Define required and optional fields for each record, ensuring essential data is always present, with incremental data entry possible.
8.  **Imprecise Information Handling:** Design the vocabulary to accommodate inherent imprecision or ambiguity in cultural heritage information (e.g., uncertain dates, disputed attributions) through repeatable fields, polyhierarchies, and explanatory notes.

**Rules for Constructing (Editorial Rules):**

-   **Establishing Terms:Warrant:** Terms must have "literary warrant" (found in authoritative published sources) to prove their established form, spelling, usage, and meaning. For less formal vocabularies, "user warrant" (based on common user queries) or "organizational warrant" (based on internal needs) may be considered.
-   **Synonym Control:** For each concept, provide a "descriptor" (preferred term) and "alternate descriptors" or "used for terms" (variants), based on true synonymy. These include spelling variants, historical usage, and different languages.
-   **Homographs:** Distinguish homographs (terms spelled alike but with different meanings) using "qualifiers" (e.g., "drums (column components)"). Qualifiers should be brief, from a broader context, and typically enclosed in parentheses.
-   **Capitalization:** Follow standard usage (e.g., generic terms lowercase, proper names capitalized).
-   **Regulating Hierarchical Relationships:Logical Consistency:** Ensure relationships are logical "up the tree" (child is part of parent and all ancestors) and "down the tree" (all children are a "kind of" or "type of" the parent).
-   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Ideally, sibling terms within a hierarchy should be independent and mutually exclusive in meaning.
-   **Homogeneous Branches:** All records in a branch should refer to the same class of things (e.g., only "objects" under an object branch, not "techniques"). Associative relationships can link related concepts across different branches.
-   **Mixing Relationships:** If different types of hierarchical relationships (whole/part, genus/species, instance) are mixed, they should be clearly flagged.
-   **Facets and Guide Terms:** Use "facets" (broad conceptual categories) and "guide terms" (node labels) to organize complex hierarchies logically and consistently. Guide terms should be visually distinct and not used for indexing.
-   **Polyhierarchies:** Allow for concepts to have multiple parents when logically necessary, indicating a "preferred parent" for default displays and noting non-preferred ones.
-   **Sorting:** Define consistent sorting rules for siblings in hierarchical displays (alphabetical, chronological, or other logical order).

1.  **Display Rules:** Plan for how the vocabulary will be displayed to different user types (creators, indexers, end-users), considering features like indentation, notation, full record displays, and search results lists.
2.  **Reciprocity:** Ensure all relationships are reciprocal (e.g., if A is a broader term of B, then B must be a narrower term of A).

Thorough documentation of all these rules is essential for maintaining consistency and quality throughout the vocabulary's lifecycle.
